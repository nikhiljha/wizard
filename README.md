# wizard

Send files to anyone directly, only using a centralized server as a rendezvous. Based on [schollz/croc](https://github.com/schollz/croc).

This is mostly a toy project at this point, and does not yet implement all the features of croc. Help is wanted though, check the open issues for anything marked as such and feel free to leave PRs. :)
